  ### Leap Year Finder
- **Description:** This assignment involved writing a C++ program to determine leap years within a given date range. The user inputs a start date and an end year, and the program calculates all the leap years within that interval. Through this project, I reinforced my understanding of basic C++ programming concepts, including string manipulation, loops, conditionals, and working with vectors.

- **Key Concepts:** 
  - String manipulation (using `substr` to parse input)
  - Conditional statements (checking leap year conditions)
  - Loops (iterating through years)
  - Working with vectors (storing and iterating through leap years)
